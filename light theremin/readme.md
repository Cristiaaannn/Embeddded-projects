The theremin is an electronic musical instrument that can make create unique sounds without any physical contact, separating it from all the other traditional instruments. The theremin is capable of controlling the frequency (oscillation) and amplitude (volume) produced.

This project replaces the two metal antennas with a light dependent resistor or a photoresistor to determine the frequency and volume produced by a piezo buzzer. Thus, resulting in a digital light-controlled theremin
