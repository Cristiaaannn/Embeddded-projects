# Embeddded-projects
This repository represents a personal portfolio in job-seeking purposes.
If you are reading this, I have a big thank you to say!
I've tried my best to gather all my projects in arduino here. In order to be able to present them, I rebuild each one on a separate arduino set-up to show how they are functioning. Unfortunately, I lost access to my faculty email and moodle address where I submitted another ones for labs and I wasn't able to recover them :( .
This repo is what I have done so far on my own to learn embedded programming.
I'm learning embedded C because I am passionate about how software can improve and impact things that are surrounding us.
Also, my idols are Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs in terms of career and technology mindset. ( Just to understand my science orientation )
I know it isn't much, but I am extremely committed to learn and grow, I just need a chance ( I took many courses, spent many months on learning platforms, still the only way to learn professional stuff and is to have a professional activity ).
Remember what I was saying on the 3rd line? Thank you! Time is precious and I fully appreciate your effort.

Best regards, 
Cristian Mirea
